## Overview

This repo utilises Flask, Docker, Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx to loosely imitate the tech stack of instagram. Utilising this tech stack, this repo can support the uploading of a file to a server, and the remote access of that file (an image). Done through a web browser, this works similar to a stripped down social media app. Docker's general purpose is to standardize software versions / downloads across users so that the same programs can run successfully on different systems. As a result, this product should be able to work across different systems and computers. Below is a gif of an image being uploaded and then being served through a seperate link.
